Class::DataStore 0.05
=====================

DESCRIPTION

Class::DataStore implements a simple storage system for object data.
This data can be accessed via get/set methods and AUTOLOAD. AUTOLOAD
calls are not added to the symbol table, so using get/set will be
faster.

This module was written originally as part of a website framework that
was used for the Democratic National Committee website in 2004. Some of
the implementations here, such as get() optionally returning a list if
called in array context, reflect the way this module was originally used
for building web applications.

Class::DataStore is most useful when subclassed. To preserve the
AUTOLOAD functionality, be sure to add the following when setting up the
subclass:

  use base 'Class::DataStore';
  *AUTOLOAD = \&Class::DataStore::AUTOLOAD;
															
INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
